# requirments: You are on a vacation in a foreign country and you need to exchange some currency to pay for your expenses.
#
# You have all the skills which are needed to create an application (maybe even the web one).
#
# Excited to try it out you open your laptop and start developing a currency exchange application.
#
#
#
# Requirements
#
# - retrieve a current rate for at least 5 currencies (ideally for every available currency)
#
# - convert an amount provided by user from one currency to another
#
# - based on current and historic data get the information about the trend of the rate and suggest if it is a good moment for an exchange of a given currency (or currencies)
#
# - allow user for creation of a stop order (an order to buy or sell a currency once the price reaches a specific price, known as the stop price.
#
#                 When the stop price is reached, a stop order becomes a market order and is executed at the best available price (which can be lower or higher than the stop price).
#
#                 Stop orders aren't guaranteed to execute until the price of the currency reaches the set stop price.)
#
# - allow user for creation of a limit order (an order to buy or sell currency at a price you choose, or better. Buy limit orders are executed at your specified price or lower,
#
#                 sell limit orders are executed at your specified price or higher. Limit orders aren't guaranteed â€“ they'll only exchange if the price of a currency increases or decreases to your set limit price.
#
#                 If it doesn't, your order is left unfilled.)
#
# - data retrieved from external sources should be stored in a csv file (or database)
#
# - plot a chart showing rates across specific time frame.
#
# - create a chart showing rates change across day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year for one or more currencies
